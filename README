This tool sniffs RS232 serial traffic using an Arduino and an RS232 transceiver. The Maxim MAX208E is the tested transceiver chip and converts the voltage levels from RS232 levels to 5V logic levels. The multiple hardware serial lines of the Arduino Mega 2560 allows both the RX and TX lines to be simultaneously captured. The captured data is then formatted and forwarded to the sniffing computer via the Arduino USB port.
